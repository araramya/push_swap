# push_swap
This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using
the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various types of algorithms and choose the one (of many) most appropriate solution for an optimized data sorting.

*instructions to run the programm:
- make re
- ./push_swap <arguments>

*instructions to run checkerMAC

- bash
- ARG="1 5 2 4 3"; ./push_swap $ARG | ./checker_OS $ARG"

if it's show you OK everything is fine.

  
  
  ALGORITHM
  If you use this algorithm your final grade will be :
  >700 - in case of 100 numbers
  >9000 - in case of 500 numbers.
  
  1. First of all you need to understand how instructions work:
sa : swap a - swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a. Do nothing if there
       is only one or no elements).
sb : swap b - swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack b. Do nothing if there
     is only one or no elements).
ss : sa and sb at the same time.
pa : push a - take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a. Do
     nothing if b is empty.
pb : push b - take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b. Do
     nothing if a is empty.
ra : rotate a - shift up all elements of stack a by 1. The first element becomes
     the last one.
rb : rotate b - shift up all elements of stack b by 1. The first element becomes
     the last one.
rr : ra and rb at the same time.
rra : reverse rotate a - shift down all elements of stack a by 1. The last element 
      becomes the first one.
rrb : reverse rotate b - shift down all elements of stack b by 1. The last element
      becomes the first one.
rrr : rra and rrb at the same time.
  
  After understanfing it you must write a code for doing it. It will be very easy if you will use linked list but also you can use arrays. I chose linked list.
  
  2. SORT_3
Let's start sorting. In case of 3 numbes you have just six possible options. So just code it without thinking about algorithm. For example you have "1 2 3" numbers your possible options will be:
  1) 1 2 3           4) 3 2 1
  2) 2 1 3           5) 1 3 2
  3) 3 2 1           6) 2 3 1
  
  1) I < II < III -> don't do anything.
  2) III > I > II -> sa
  3) III < II < I -> sa, rra
  4) II < III < I -> ra
  5) I < III < II -> sa, ra
  6) II > I > III -> rra
  
  
  after this you can sort 3 numbers maximum in 2 steps.
  
  
  3. SORT_5
  Now we can think about 5 numbers. How to sort it ?
  Here is my algorithm that you can use for it.
  
  find MIN of a -> MIN to top -> push MIN to b -> find MIN of a -> MIN to top -> push MIN to b -> sort_3 -> pa, pa
  
  
  4. BIG_SORTING
  Let's think what if I have more than 5 numbers ?
  Here is my solution.
  
  1) Create temperary array temp_arr
  2) Copy your a to temp_arr.
  3) Sort temp_arr (Quick-Sort, Merge-sort or even Bubble_Sort it doesn't matter you just need sorted array for future steps)
  4) Take a point which is equal to point = temp_arr[n/3] where n is the number of a which is changing.
  
  then i will use this pseudo code;
  len = 0;
i = 0;
while(i < n)
{
    if(a->top > point && aa->last < point)
    rra;
    elif(a->top < point)
    {
        pb;
        if(sizeof(b) >= 2)
            if(b->top < b->next->top)
            sb;
        len++;
    }
    elif(sizeof(b) > 1 && b->top < b->next->top < b->next->top)
        rr;
    else ra;
    i++;
} 
  
  than check
  if (sizeof(a) == 3)
  sort_3
  elif sizeof(a) > 3
   BIG_SORTING(a,b,n_len) -> Recursion
  
  now you need to sort b and push it to a;
  for that you need to find maximum of b and push it to a, and do it untill b is empty.
  
  THAT'S it, you've done it, CONGRATS !!!!
  
  Don't forget about checkings and leaks.
  
  GOOD LUCK !!!
