# push_swap
This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using
the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various types of algorithms and choose the one (of many) most appropriate solution for an optimized data sorting.

*instructions to run the programm:
- make
- ./push_swap <arguments>

*instructions to run checkerMAC

- bash
- ARG="1 5 2 4 3"; ./push_swap $ARG | ./checker_OS $ARG"

if it's show you OK everything is fine.
